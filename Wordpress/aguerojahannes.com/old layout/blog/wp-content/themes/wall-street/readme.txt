### Post Formats ###

This theme supports the following post formats &mdash; gallery, image, video, quote and standard &mdash; which are unique layouts for specific types of posts. Each post format has its own unique layout on single post page. Adding the WP Post Format plugin will improve the WordPress admin interface and make creating Post Formats simple and intuitive. You can download that plugin here:

https://github.com/crowdfavorite/wp-post-formats

While all the post formats work with default behaviour, here are some that have unique characteristics:

* Gallery - To show a slideshow of images (an image gallery), upload as many images as you like using the media uploader tool and insert the Gallery into the post. Be sure to assign a Featured Image for that post. For best results, use images that are at least 800 pixels wide. All posts assigned to the Gallery Post Format will then display the Gallery at the top of the post, with any text added into your post's edit page displayed below.

    To insert a gallery:

    1. Switch to the Gallery tab.
	2. Click the Add Media button to launch the Media Uploader tool.
	3. Click the Create Gallery option.
	4. You can choose to upload images from your computer or you can use images that already exist in your Media Library. You cannot use an image from a URL on the web in your gallery.
	5. If you are uploading images, click the Select Files button and navigate to each of your images on your computer. Click the Open button to open each image.
	6. Once each of your images has been uploaded, you will have the option to add a title, caption, alternative text and description.
	7. After you have added all of the images you wish to display in the gallery, switch to your media library tab and select those images.
	8. Then, click the Create a New Gallery button.
	9. Set a featured image for your Gallery.

* Video - To display a video in your post, switch to the Video tab. Paste your video's embed code in the Video URL or Embed Code field. The video will display above all post content on the homepage, single, and archive pages. This works for all interactive elements (videos, maps, panoramas) that have embed code. You can also add additional interactive elements into the content area, though these will appear inside the content area, rather than above it.

### Page Templates ###

This theme provides eight four templates: Default, Blog, Blog Grid, Team.

1. The Default page template is the standard page layout, and will display the Sidebar if you have it activated in your widgets area.
2. The Blog page template will display all of your blog posts on this page. You can determine how many posts will appear on each page before the 'Older Entries' link in Settings &gt; Reading, by setting a value for 'Blog Pages Display at Most'.
3. The Blog Grid page template will display all of your blog posts on this page in grid layout. You can determine how many posts will appear on each page before the 'Older Entries' link in Settings &gt; Reading, by setting a value for 'Blog Pages Display at Most'.
