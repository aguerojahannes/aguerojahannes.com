		<h2>Project Description</h2>
		<p>Art of Ascent is a web app that I conceived of, designed and developed to give artists a business plan guide so they can focus on their creativity while growing a business.</p>
		<p>Artists will find in their dashboard each section of a business plan where they can go to to think about and answer important questions that solidify a plan. Special features include a brainstorm area, which is available throughout the app to jot down notes, and a resource list and chat area specific to each section for additional insight and motivation.</p>
		<p>When an artist completes a section, they can review, edit or view their work, and when they complete all sections, they have a foundation, a direction and a business plan they can print to PDF!</p>
